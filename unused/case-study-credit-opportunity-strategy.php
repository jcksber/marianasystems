The firm wanted a system that would proactively identify and systematically monitor all of the credit metrics (ie. Operating, Leverage, Debt Servicing, Asset Coverage) across their portfolio. There was also a need to have an executive summary view of credit information along with the option to drill down into the credit metrics of any specific company or tranche.
