                                        The manager was looking for a system that could assist with transforming and organizing large amounts of detailed credit data. The manager required multiple levels of reporting: standard reports, dynamic “ad hoc” reporting, portfolio dashboards, configurable dashboards. The overall objective was to develop a platform that would identify and escalate credit issues across the portfolio in a timely manner. There was also a strong desire to eliminate the need for performing time consuming reconciliations of data across multiple systems and data sources.
